# Tinder Clone

I created this Tinder Clone mini-application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
It allows you to swipe left or right on people.
Also it has the UI for viewing your messages, and chat with people.

**New things I learned doing this:**
* *react-tinder-card*: allows you to swipe elements like in real Tinder app
* *useHistory* function to be able to go to a previous url
