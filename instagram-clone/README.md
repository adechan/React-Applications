# Instagram Clone

I created this Instagram clone application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
It has user authentification, allowing you create accounts and login. Also once you are logged in, you can create posts and add messages to your or other people's posts.

**New things I learned doing this:**
* *Firebase* is a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas)
* *conditional rendering*: render elements based on a condition
* *user authentification* using Firebase
* Firebase *storage*
* *react-instagram-embed*
