# Instagram Clone

I created this Instagram clone application following Clever Programmer's [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7T48W0cwXM&t=8517s&ab_channel=CleverProgrammer) using React and Firebase.

It has user authentification, allowing you create accounts and login. Also once you are logged in, you can create posts and add messages to your or other people's posts.
