# Netflix Clone

I created this Netflix clone application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
I'm doing a request to TMDB (a 3rd party server) so I can populate the rows with movie/ series posters. 
</br> 
Once you click on a poster it's gonna pop out a trailer for it.
