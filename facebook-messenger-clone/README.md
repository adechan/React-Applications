# Facebok Messenger - basic application

I created this Facebook Messenger application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
It has a basic functionality and design, allowing you to chat with anyone around the world. 

**New things I learned doing this:**
* *BEM* naming convention
* The difference between *map* and *foreach*: map returns something
* *useEffect Hook* allows you to run a piece of code once a component loads
* *useEffect*: block of code that gets executed based on a condition
* *useState*: sets up a piece of state
* Use of *react-flipmove* for animated chat
* To add *key* to a component so it only re-renders the top one and leaves everything else the same
