# Todo - basic application

I created this Todo application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
It has a basic functionality and design, just enough so you can create new todos, delete, and update the old ones. 

**New things I learned doing this:**
* *state*: similar with a short term memory (preserves the state between re-renders)
* *JSX* is JavaScript + HTML
* How to work with components
* How to work with firebase 
* How to work with firebase's database and hosting
