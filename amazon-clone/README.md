# Amazon Clone

I created this Amazon Clone application following Clever Programmer's Tutorial using React and Firebase.
</br>
It has user authentification, allowing you to create accounts and log into your account. On the main page you can see a list of products, which you can add into your cart, and in your cart page, you can see the list with the products you wanted to buy, and the total sum for buying these items.
